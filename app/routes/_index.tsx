            Super Duper Gallery Offers a Portal Further Beyond
          </h3>
          <p>
            A contemporary art gallery that welcomes a wide range of artistic
            provocations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artists are given the opportunity to explore and creatively labor
            upon the energy that drives their limitless imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gallery embraces a range of expressions and intentions, from
            serious to the unapologetically whimsical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artists may freely choose the contemplative in challenging yet
            innovative ways or provide an occasional jesting commentary.
          </p>
          <p>
            They can also renegotiate ontologies of art and rethink parameters
            of validity in the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it is physically located in Quezon City, the gallery offers
            a glimpse into the diverse contemporary art practices and media that
            artists have to offer regardless of ethnicity, nationality, and
            geographic borders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Super Duper is a contemporary art gallery that features carefully
            curated exhibitions that transcend conceptual boundaries,
            established trends, and cliques.
          </p>
          <p>
            The innovative program of exhibitions is reflective of the galleryâ€™s
            dictum: ignore the compulsory and pursue the super duper.
          </p>
          <h3 className="uppercase">Our Expertise</h3>

            The gallery offers facilities and services for solo and group

          </p>
          <p>
            The gallery serves as a platform for emerging and established
            artists from across and outside the archipelago.
          </p>
