          <p>A contemporary art gallery that welcomes a wide range of artistic provocations.</p>
          <p>
            Artists are given the opportunity to explore and creatively labor upon the energy that
            drives their limitless imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gallery embraces a range of expressions and intentions, from serious to the
            unapologetically whimsical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artists may freely choose the contemplative in challenging yet innovative ways or
            provide an occasional jesting commentary.
          </p>
          <p>
            They can also renegotiate ontologies of art and rethink parameters of validity in the
            market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it is physically located in Quezon City, the gallery offers a glimpse into the
            diverse contemporary art practices and media that artists have to offer regardless of
            ethnicity, nationality, and geographic borders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Super Duper is a contemporary art gallery that features carefully curated exhibitions
            that transcend conceptual boundaries, established trends, and cliques.
          </p>
          <p>
            The innovative program of exhibitions is reflective of the galleryâ€™s dictum: ignore the
            compulsory and pursue the super duper.
          </p>
          <h3 className="uppercase">Our Expertise</h3>
          <p>

            marketing, and project management.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gallery serves as a platform for emerging and established artists from across and
            outside the archipelago.
          </p>
          <p>
